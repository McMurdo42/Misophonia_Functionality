# Misophonia_Functionality
The purpose of this program is to attempt to measure the effect certain sounds have on an individual as they complete a simple task. To use count the number of dots the same color as the bar at the top of the screen and subtract 10 and press that number on the keyboard.
I am still tweaking the program and need to compile a larger library of sounds.
I apologize for the messy code.
